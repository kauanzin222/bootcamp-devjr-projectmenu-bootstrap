# Menu Project üçΩÔ∏è

  - This project is very **special** for me because it is an *update* of the [Menu Project](https://github.com/kauanzin222/bootcamp-devjr-ProjetoMenu.git) that I had just done with:
    
      - HTML;
      - CSS;
      - JavaScript.
        
  - Now, in this project, I must remaster it with **BootStrap**, and this brought a new vision to me, I tried to make the site new with a much better interface, I applied components that I had learned and I was very concerned about responsiveness.
    
## Final Result:

### Modal
  - By clicking "Calcular" I used the modal component to display a summary of the order. Warning if an **item has not been selected or the name is invalid**.
